# MitoMAPR-JacobDay
Modified ImageJ Macro based on a program called MitoMAPR from https://elifesciences.org/articles/49158/figures#scode1

Code altered to:
- Take .lif images with mitochondria in channel 3
- Max intensity project z-stacks
- Allow selection of multiple ROIs
- Loop through ROIs, segmenting and quantifying mitochondria
